    The following procedure shall be followed by the World Health Organization i n the selection of recom-
mended international nonproprietary names for pharmaceutical substances, in accordance with the World
Health Assembly resolution WHA3.11 :
1. Proposals for recommended international nonproprietary names shall be submitted t o the World Health
Organization on the form provided therefor.
2. Such proposals shall be submitted by the Director-General of the World Health Organization t o the
members of the Expert Advisory Panel on the lnternational Pharmacopoeia and Pharmaceutical Preparations
designated for this purpose, for consideration i n accordance with the " General principles for guidance in
devising lnternational Nonproprietary Names ",appended t o this procedure. The name used by the person
discovering or first developing and marketing a pharmaceutical substance shall be accepted, unless there
are compelling reasons t o the contrary.
3. Subsequent to the examination provided for in article 2, the Director-General of the World Health Organi-
zation shall give notice that a proposed international nonproprietary name is being considered.
      A. Such notice shall be given by publication i n the Chronicle o f the World Health Organization'
      and by letter t o Member States and t o national pharmacopoeia commissions or other bodies
      designated by Member States.

            (i) Notice may also be sent to specific persons known to be concerned with a name under con-
                sideration.
      B. Such notice shall :
            (i) set forth the name under consideration;
           (ii) identify the person w h o submitted a proposal for naming the substance, if so requested by such
                person ;
           (iii) identify the substance for which a name is being considered;
           (iv) set forth the time within which comments and objections will be received and the person and
                 place to whom they should be directed;
           (v) state the authority under which the World Health Organization is acting and refer to these rules
               of procedure.
      C. I n forwarding the notice, the Director-General of the World Health Organization shall request that
      Member States take such steps as are necessary t o prevent the acquisition of proprietary rights i n the
      proposed name during the period it is under consideration by the World Health Organization.

    within four months of the date of publication, under article 3, of the name in the Chronicle of the World

    5. A formal objection to a proposed name may be filed by any interested person within four months of the
    date of publication, under article 3, of the name in the Chronicle of the World Health Organization.
         A. Such objection shall:

    not be selected by the World Health Organization as a recommended international nonproprietary name
     while there exists a formal objection thereto ftled under article 5 which has not been withdrawn.
    7. Where no objection has been filed under article 5, or all objections prevrouslyfiled have been withdrawn,
    the Director-General of the World Health Organization shall give notice in accordance with subsection A
    of article 3 that the name has been selected by the World Health Organization as a recommended inter-
    national nonproprietary name.
    8. In forwarding a recommended international nonproprietary name to Member States under article 7, the
    Director-General of the World Health Organization shall :
         A. request that it be recognized as the nonproprietary name for the substance; and
         B. request that Member States take such steps as are necessary to prevent the acquisition of proprietary

                     GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR GUIDANCE I N DEVISING
             ATIONAL NONPROPRIETARY NAMES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCES*

        Names should be distinctive in sound and spelling. They should not be inconveniently long and should
       t be liable to confusion with names already in common use.
            name for a substance belonging to a group of pharmacologically related substances should, where
           iate, show this relationship. Names that are likely to convey to a patient an anatomical, physio-
           pathological or therapeutic suggestion should be avoided.
         The above primary principles are to be implemented by utilization of the following secondary principles.
           devising the name of the first substance in a new pharmacological group (the parent substance),
           eration should be given to the possibility of devising suitable names for related substances belonging

                                        matic chemical name of a substance, syllables such as " methylhydro ",
                     " chlor"should preferably be abbreviated, for example, to " medro ", " meto ", and " clo ";
                      should not be chemically misleading.
               naming of substances which are acids, existing names generally used in chemistry which include
              " acidum " ("acid ") should be used, if the name is adequate for practical use in therapy and
                  other circumstances, the substance should be named by a single word and not by a name
                    he word " acid  ".Where the word " acid " is not used in the name, as is customary in the
                       salt should preferably be named without modification of the parent acid name, e.g.,

                   substances which are used as salts should in general apply to the active base (or the active
                   for different salts or esters of the same active substance should differ only in respect of the

                     WHO/Pharm/68.447, and WHO/Pharm/70.458).


                                                                                                                 437
    For quaternary ammonium substances, the cation and anion should be named appropriately
components of a quaternary substance and not in the amine-salt style.
7. The use of an isolated letter or number should be avoided; hyphenated construction is also un
8. To facilitate translation and pronunciation " f " should preferably be used instead of " ph "," t " in
                                                                 ".
of " th "," e " instead of ae " or " oe ",and " i " instead of " y
                            "




9. Provided that the names suggested are in accordance with these principles, names proposed by
person discovering or first developing and marketing a pharmaceutical preparation, or names alre
officially in use in any country, should receive preferential consideration.
